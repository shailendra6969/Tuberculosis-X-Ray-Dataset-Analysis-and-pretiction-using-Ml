ðŸ©º Tuberculosis X-Ray Dataset Analysis & Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project presents a machine learning approach to detect Tuberculosis (TB) from chest X-ray images. Utilizing image processing techniques and classification algorithms, the model aims to assist in the early diagnosis of TB by analyzing radiographic images.

ðŸ“Œ Features
Data Preprocessing: Resizing, normalization, and augmentation of chest X-ray images to enhance model performance.

Model Training: Implementation of machine learning classifiers to distinguish between TB-positive and TB-negative cases.

Performance Evaluation: Assessment using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualization: Graphical representation of model performance and data distribution.

ðŸ§° Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn

Frameworks: Jupyter Notebook for interactive development
